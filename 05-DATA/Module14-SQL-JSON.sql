--===========================--

/*

	JSON is a flat data format that is good for small sets of info
	
		- Self describing
		- Less bloated than XML (smaller file size)
		- Easier to deal with in a browser
		- Can be parsed and used with many programming languages
		-- SYNTAX NOTES:
			-- Data comes in name/value pairs that are comma seperated
			-- Each object is contained in curly braces {}
			-- JSON
