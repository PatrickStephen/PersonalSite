                <p>
                    Front-End development is the tier of fullstack web development that deals with the visual elements of an application that a user interacts with. The main three languages used in Front-End development is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the three languages that web browsers can understand.

                    If you were to compare this tier of development to a part of the human body, it would be like the skin.

                    <p>
                        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to define the structure of the content of a web page. It is arguably the most important Front-End development language, because the other two languages use HTML elements to perform their respective functions.

                    <h3> CSS </h3>
                    <p>
                        Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) is used for the formatting and layout of web page content. It was introduced as a way to separate the concerns of markup (HTML) and formatting (CSS) into separate files.

                    <h3> JS </h3>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript (JS) allows us to make our web pages more interactive. Its primary used to provide the ability to perform programming logic in the Front-End, react to events, and validate form data.

                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum is sample text that is often used when websites are being designed before the actual written copy has been created. Traditionally, it was written in latin but there are now many online resources for generating themed lorem ipsum.
